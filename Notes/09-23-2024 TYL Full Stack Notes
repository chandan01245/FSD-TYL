So previously we went to views.py
One Issue is that we have to return HTML files manually.
But there are nxn number of HTML lines so to avoid this we are going to return a HTML file called a template.

-We store templates in a folder. And call on them using a templateData function.
*We also make sure to tell the project where our templates are, 
'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')],
*and again make a provision in the urls.py File

-We make a template, template1.html And 
*then do html:5 to generate the boilerplate and add our little <h1> Tag inside there.


So it seems that how it goes is that. it goes to
"project1/urls.py"
from that we include "app1/urls.py"
And in that we have our **data** and **template**
