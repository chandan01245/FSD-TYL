Today we're gonna be pasing the entire data as opposed to just a single string

We pass an array by using the following.

in Views.py
a = ['abc','def','ghi']

and

in template1.html
<table>
    <tr>
        {%for elements in array%}
            <td> {{elements}} </td>
        {% endfor %}
    </tr>
</table>
