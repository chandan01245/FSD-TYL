Frontend : HTML

Backend : Django

We see that when we add Templates, we connect the two of em.
Currently we can load templates which is good

But now, how would we render a value from the backend into the Frontend
eg:

name = "Kaio"
Which we got after reading a file, now we want to print it on the HTML Frontend
HOw we do it is:-

BACKEND:
'''return render(request, 'template1.html', {"backend_data": name})'''

FRONTEND
{{backend_data}}

This outputs the value of 'backend_data', into the page
